# Compliance Report

A vocabulary that is used to elaborate the result of an evaluation of an ODRL Policy, ODRL Request and the state of the world. <br>
It elaborates not only **whether** a rule from a policy is active, but also **why**.

It has been modelled by taking in the [specification of the ODRL Formal Semantics](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/formal-semantics/) and iterated upon through discussions between Beatriz and Wout.

The Compliance Report Model can be found at the root of this repository: [`ComplianceReportModel.ttl`](./ComplianceReportModel.ttl)

Below is a visualisation of this report.
